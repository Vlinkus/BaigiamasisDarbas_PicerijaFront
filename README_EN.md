## How to Run the Project with Docker?

â†“ â†“ â†“  Create an image (-t for tag) â†“ â†“ â†“

> docker build -t myapp:v1 .

â†“ â†“ â†“ â†“ Run a new container (with volume!)

> docker run --name myapp_c_nodemon -p 3000:3000 --rm -v C:\...\BaigiamasisDarbas_PicerijaFront:app/ -v /app/node_modules myapp:nodemon

### API Commands

By default, the project port is set to 3000.
In all API-related links in these sections, the aforementioned port will be used.

#### Registration

Account registration is a fairly straightforward process:

- This can be done on the website, but to have higher roles such as ADMIN or MANAGER, you need to use Postman or change the registered user's role in the SQL database.

Postman instructions:

- Set the HTTP request to POST
- Set the address to localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/register
- Send a JSON body, as shown in the example below:

```json
{
  "firstname": "Vardenis",
  "lastname": "Pavardenis",
  "username": "vartotojoVardas",
  "email": "kaz@kas.lt",
  "password": "slaptazodis",
  "role": "ADMIN"
}
```

It's important to note that the "role" field is not mandatory, and the sender can omit it.
In that case, the default role for the registered user will be "USER".

All possible role options: USER, MANAGER, ADMIN

#### Login

Login requires only two fields.

- Set the HTTP request to  `POST`
- Set the address to `localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login`

```json
{
  "username": "someUsername",
  "password": "password"
}
```

Upon successful authentication, you will receive the **_JWT refresh token_**,
the user's **_role_**  and the  **_HttpOnly refresh token cookie_**.
